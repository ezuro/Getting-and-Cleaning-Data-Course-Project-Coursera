## Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project-Coursera
Repository including the peer reviewed Getting and Cleaning Data Course project from Coursera. Which purpose is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

It was used the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Repository. See reference:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Which it was built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.


    

### In this project you will find the scripts:

    -README.md: Introductory file.
    -run_analysis.R: R Script where the Data Set was collected, worked with and cleaned.
    -CodeBook.md: File with additional details describing the data employed and analysis done on this project.
