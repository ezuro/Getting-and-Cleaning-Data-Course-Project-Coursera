## Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project-Coursera
Repository including the peer reviewed Getting and Cleaning Data Course project from Coursera. Which purpose is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

It was used the [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set ](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) from UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Which it was built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

### The objectives of the course project are:

    1) a tidy data set as described below 
    2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
    3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

            1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
            2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
            3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
            4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
            5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.


    

### In this project you will find the following scripts and files:

    -README.md : Introductory file.
    -run_analysis.R : R Script where the Data Set was collected, worked with and cleaned.
    -CodeBook.md : File with additional details describing the data employed and analysis done on this project.
